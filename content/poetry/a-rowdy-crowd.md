### For a rowdy crowd

My art was meant for a rowdy crowd  
Meant for loud rooms with loud tunes  
Rooms with libations and indulgences all around  
For the people society has doomed  
But who refused to give into doom and gloom  
My art is meant for the resilient hearts  
Who fought for what is right despite being torn down, held back, and pulled apart  
My art is meant for the revolutionaries  
Who don't seek to comfort their oppressors during protest  
Who hit the streets with fists held high  
Held high in solidarity with their fellow comrade  
Who refused to accept the status quo  
Who refused to turn a blind eye to injustice  
Who refused to stand by, be standing by, or be the bystander to the atrocities that face their fellow human  
My art was meant for the big hearted, loud mouthed, emotional as fuck, determined searchers of the truth  
Who recognized that the rules aren't fair, and decided to say fuck the system and fight the power.  

My art is meant for you.  
Through and through.
