## Hello World, I'm Wisdom

I have lost count of how many times I have sat down to publish a blog, and how many times I go down some
deep rabbit hole, because I try to build something too complex, or try to do it using some
technology with which I'm not at all familiar. It gets hard, and then I just scrap the whole thing.

THIS TIME IS DIFFERENT! I think.

It usually goes something like this:
- I should start a blog
- I should use the fact that I'm building a blog to learn something new. Like a new language
- I should also host it, so that I can add some fancy server side things later! After all, I 
*am* a backend engineer
- You know what I should do, I should build something using docker, you can never have enough practice with containers
- You know, I should really see what it takes to stand up my own kubernetes cluster and build all the components from scratch
- Oh look an open source cloud platform, I should just stand up my own cloud platform, then I can put the k8 cluster in there
- Wow this is a lot, let me go do another hobby for a while.

But this time is different, this time I have given myself constraints. I will still use this to learn something new
BUT, I will host this on Github Pages! That should simplify things, and also restrict what I can and cannot do.
So, you know, less likely to fall down massive rabbit holes.

Which brings me to the WHY

Everyone and their mom has a blog, why do I feel like I should also make one?

I've faced this question everytime I try to embark on something creative, or exploratory. Particularly when I think 
of publishing said thing. I had the same feeling when I started my YouTube Channel. And worse, when 
I actually mustered up the courage to do it, I got that exact feedback from some friends. They pretty much
shrugged at the idea and that made me extremely self-conscious. All the fear of doing it, or being judged, of someone
thinking you don't get to do this; "who do you think you are"...

But I pushed that anyway, because first and foremost, I enjoy it. 

I enjoy coming up with things to talk and write about.  
I enjoy making things.  
I enjoy learning things.  
And I enjoy sharing things.  
And I hope, that me deciding to do things, will make someone else out there feel like they can also do things.  
Especially people that look like me, who don't always get encouraged to do things.  
Like write code, and make art.  

So hi! I'm Wisdom, this is my blog. It is one of the things I made! Hope you like it :)
