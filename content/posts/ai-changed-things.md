## LLMs Have Legitimately Changed My Life

I should say, specifically Gemini and Claude Code have legitimately changed my life.

When the whole chatGPT explosion happened, I remember being a bit confused why people were so excited about it. Google had
been working on amazing AI tech for years. Some of which they abandoned, and are now _kinda_ bringing back. Things like [google now
on tap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1aURqyKWH0). At the time, the AI "thing" was machine learning, which like, aren't LLMs basically
just machine learning?

Anyway, so I wasn't impressed with ChatGPT especially because of how wrong it was about SO MANY things initially. Then google released Bard 
(later to be renamed to Gemini for some unexplained reason). It also made a lot of mistakes.
I starte to kinda dounbt the technology. It didn't seem worth the potential and very real impact on the environment, and the 
MASSIVE AMMOUNT THEFT! 

I still don't think it'll ever be worth that, but these tools have become legitimately useful in my everyday life.

At some point, it crossed the line, somewhere between cursor, which seemed convincingly good, but felt distant from me.
1. Because I used IntelliJ as my IDE, and I really disliked using VSCode, so it was a hard-sell for development.
2. For personal things, the friction of having to download a new app, or use a website seemed like too much of a hassle.
(I really don't like downloading new apps in general)

And then I got access Claude Code at work. When I learned this app was a CLI tool, I was intrigued because 
there's nothing that says "This is for software engineers" like building something for the Terminal.

It was impressive, but not mind-blowing. Not until I watched a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZ-zzHVUrO4) 
and Anthropic introduced the skills feature, which was like creating little minion pieces of instruction sets for specified tasks. 

The first thing I used it to do was automate our dependabot merges. If you know what those are, you know they are SUCH A CHORE.
Claude has basically taken over that task for me, and it's such low risk of a task. 

Today, Claude Code is a full coding assistant for me. With enough examples, and clear instructions, it can save you a massive amount of time. 
Time trying to find the right documentation. Time tweaking configurations in 18 different ways because the documentation is always too vague! 
It saves you time creating huge test objects, with realistic test values. Time reading long complex stack traces or formating data!

It also makes me _very_ sad. 

On one hand, for businesses, this is an obvious win. If you are a small shop, your engineers just got at least
a little faster, and more likely a lot faster, and you just had to add an extra $200 ish /month license for each of them. 
From a company perspective it is a huge cost benefits. 

But for engineers, I would argue it's probably not great. With great power, comes great responsibility. There are two
versions of this.

Version 1: With great power, comes great responsibility:
- 
First, the great power is the efficiency and speed you've gained, and the responsibility is the amount of work your company
is now going to expect you to complete in a sprint. They will expect either a higher quality of work, a faster delivery,
or both!. I've already seen this start to happen within the software engineering community. Historically,
companies have not compensated workers more when they become more efficient. It would be nice, if the companies said: 

"hey, because you have this tool that makes you so much more efficient, we will now have 4-day weekends!"

If anything, the opposite is happening, we're losing our jobs!

Version 2: With great power, comes great responsibility. 
- 
Second, the great power is the ability to just have code create for you. Why even plan or design features, 
just have Claude figure it out. Grab your jira ticket, throw it into Claude, and chime in every once in a while to check on it, 
Raise the PR at the end and someone else can catch its bugs. The responsibility is to NOT do this!

Something I have noticed in the content space is that the creators that spent time to build trust with their audience, and 
always put out high quality/trustworthy content don't seem impacted by the slop. In fact, it seems like people are craving more 
of that honesty. However, if you spent your time as a creator just making low quality clickbait, you're cooked. 

That's also true about being s Software Engineer. So I think a good engineer should still invest in engineering knowledge. AI is
a tool, if we must use it, we should use it to make ourselves better, not to replace ourselves.

A lot of bad, but also some real positives. It's conflicting. 

I enjoy creating things, and this shouldn't stop me from doing that. I will not use it on this blog, but I'll probably be using
at work and in other parts of my life. It legitimately makes certain things I have no interest in doing, so much easier. 

I'm really glad this blog exists though.
