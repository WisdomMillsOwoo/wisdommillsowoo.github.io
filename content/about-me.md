## About Wisdom
Hi, welcome to my blog! My name is Wisdom and here are a few notable things about me

- I was born in 🇬🇭Ghana🇬🇭
- I currently live in the USA
- I am a Software Engineer by trade
- I am happily married to a wonderful woman
- I enjoy music, hiking, writing, photography, and other things I'm sure
- I don't know if this goes without saying, but I also do enjoy writing software

### What this blog is about:

A little software engineering, a little philosophy, a little show and tell. 
It really depends on what's on my mind at the moment

### Why this blog exists:

I think everyone should have a blog. I think it is a healthy form of journaling. There is personal
journaling, which is something I love very much, but I think it's also healthy to have public
journaling. I think it's healthy to take on the exercise of writing something that other people
may read. Whether it's specific to an interest, or just some ideas and thoughts you've decided to share.

For me, this exercise forces me to imagine how my perspective would be received by others. Even when that 
doesn't cause a change, it *does* allow me to work through the reasoning of how
I may have arrived at that perspective. It forces me the validate my perspective and enables me to speak with conviction.

I also kinda just like to write about things I'm learning, or been thinking about.

I also decided to do this because I enjoy finding neat little blogs by random people online, and I've decided to 
join that community!

So welcome!
